In the biplot of setosa, it is obvious that all lengths and widths contribute with the same sign
PC1 correlates negatively with the projection of the axes of the variables in the original dataset (red vectors)
An increase in the size of the flower implies a decrease in the projected PC1 value.
We can assume that the PC1 describes the size of the flower.

In the scatterplot of PCA on all the species, we can see that the first principal component clearly seperates the species.

The PC1 strongly associates with the size of the petal wich strongly associates with the species.
Additionally, it is negatively correlated with the sepal width, as the sepal width is higher for setosa than for the other species.
Therefore, the PC1 can be interpreted as describing the species of each flower.
